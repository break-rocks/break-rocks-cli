# Changelog

All notable changes of break-rocks-cli. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
the contract is break-rocks-specs (`specs/common`: `contracts/agent-sign-in.md`, `contracts/payments.md`,
`contracts/schema.graphql`, `contracts/themes.md`). The scope is decided (D-91, 2026-10-23).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- `breakrocks mcp`: an MCP server on stdio (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.32.1). Every command of
  the registry is a tool `breakrocks_<group>_<action>` with the input schema of the registry, its
  answer the `--json` of the command (a refusal `{ "error" }` marked `isError`); the resources
  `breakrocks://whoami`, `breakrocks://capabilities` and `breakrocks://profiles`; the prompt
  `theme-prompt`. It uses the current profile (or `--profile` / `--env`), refuses a tool that asks
  a confirmation without `"yes": true`, never reads stdin for a question.
- README § MCP: Claude Code, Codex and `claude_desktop_config.json`, one line each;
  `test/smoke/mcp-stdio.mjs`, the server of the built executable driven by the SDK's client, in CI
  on Linux, macOS and Windows.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- Agent operators (`agent-sign-in.md` § Agent operators): `operator keygen` (Ed25519, or ML-DSA-65
  where `node:crypto` has it; the recovery key ML-DSA-65 by default), `operator register` (the three
  steps with the country and the confirmation of full age, then the payment with x402; a signed
  registration is taken up again within its hour), `operator login`, `operator renew`,
  `operator recover`, `operator recovery-key set`, `operator delete` (confirmation).
- Sessions (C-06): kept per profile (0600), renewed 5 minutes before their end with the current
  token (same session); a token refused by the API signs in once more, which tells why; `session`
  (`--renew`).
- Delegated agents: `agents create` (the private key written to `--out` or the configuration folder,
  0600, never printed; `--save-profile`), `list`, `show`, `rename`, `suspend`, `reactivate`, `delete`,
  `restrict` (`--any-interaction`, `--any-universe`), `regenerate`, `activity`; refused before calling
  to a delegated agent (C-04).
- `agent login` with a key file or `BREAKROCKS_OPERATOR_ID`, `BREAKROCKS_AGENT_ID`,
  `BREAKROCKS_AGENT_KEY` (C-07); `agent attest` checks the domain of the external service and says
  `ATTESTATION_NOT_AVAILABLE` (the platform does not serve attestations yet).
- `whoami`, `usage` (C-08), `capabilities` (C-29: restrictions, limits left, state of the operator,
  payments).
- x402 (C-25 to C-27): `wallet set` (a key file copied 0600, or `--env`), `wallet show`,
  `wallet balance` (USDC on Base Sepolia or Base), `wallet faucet` (links); the 402 of the paid
  commands signed with `@x402/core` and `@x402/evm` 2.28.0 (viem 2.57.7) within `--max-usd` (1 US
  dollar by default) and the cap of the profile per UTC day (5 by default), after a confirmation,
  each payment written in the ledger of the profile.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- The registry of the commands: each one declares its name, summary, description, examples, the
  JSON Schemas of its input (options and positionals) and of its output, and its run; the help,
  `--json` and `breakrocks schema <command>` (C-30) derive from it.
- Global options: `--json`, `--quiet`, `--fields`, `--profile`, `--env dev|staging|prod` (default
  `prod`), `--yes`; no color ever (C-33); exit codes 0, 1 (refused, with the code of the contract or
  of the CLI), 2 (usage), 3 (network or session).
- Profiles (C-05): `profile add|use|list|show|remove`, `BREAKROCKS_PROFILE`, the configuration folder
  of the user (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/breakrocks`, `~/.config/breakrocks`, `%APPDATA%\breakrocks`), private
  files 0600 on POSIX; the addresses of the API from the cell map, as the apps.
- Transport on `fetch`: GraphQL (the token as is), the agents host (Bearer), a 429 tried again once
  after its Retry-After, a near RATE_LIMITED likewise.
- Offline themes: `theme prompt` (the prompt of THEME-IA-PROMPT.md, in English or French),
  `theme check` (format 2, contrast AA as the platform raises it, at most 8 images of 5 MB, the
  banner 3:1, the wordmark, approved typefaces; a JSON report for hooks, C-23), `theme pack` and
  `theme unpack` (the ZIP of the import of the studio, `node:zlib`), `theme typefaces` (the shipped
  list; `--online` compares it with `approvedTypefaces`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- The repository: the executable `breakrocks` in TypeScript on Node 24, `help` and `version` (text,
  or JSON with `--json`), lint, types, unit tests and build in CI, Dependabot with a 7-day cooldown,
  the common specs at v48.3.5; the CI runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.
